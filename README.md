## shooting-monsters-game

A somewhat refined version of an output of my tinkering with [`wgpu`](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu).

Experience the desktop version with `cargo run`.

Experience the web version by building with [`wasm-pack`](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack) (`wasm-pack build --target web`) and serving `index.html` with something like [`simple-http-server`](https://github.com/TheWaWaR/simple-http-server).
